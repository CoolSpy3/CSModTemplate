# CSModTemplate
A basic project template for a [CSModLoader](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CSModLoader) mod. By default, this will include [CSModLoader](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CSModLoader) and [CSPackets](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CSPackets). Note that in order to download dependencies, the build platform must have the project properties `gpr.user` and `gpr.key` or the enviornment variables `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` defined. The `formatting` branch provides additional code for vscode settings and formatting style.
